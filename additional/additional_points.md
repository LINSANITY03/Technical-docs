# Zevero-Emission-Additional-Points

Some the points to consider which may increase the overall security, performance of the system.

## Security

1. Implementing role based control to restrict access to sensitive api and its resources such that selected few can modify/delete or view the data.
2. Ensure the data transfer are encrypted with industry standard algorithms and regularly check for any vulnerabilities.

## Performance

1. Implementing caching mechanisms to cache frequent data or reducing database load.
2. Create a separate architecture such as a serverless or calculating distance or other cpu heavy task to reduce load and time.

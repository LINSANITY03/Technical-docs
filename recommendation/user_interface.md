# Zevero-Emission-UI-Enhancements

Some of the recommendation for the Analysis page and measurement page for better readility, usage for user.

## Analysis Page

1. Add a value labels to the barchart displaying data of different heights. Similar to [Text](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html) from [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/).
2. Add a [piechart](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/pie_features.html) for distribution of item per user.
3. Visualization of global map with heatmap showing frequent delivery for different locations, similar to [Github Globe](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-how-we-built-the-github-globe/).
4. Add more complex filter method, currently there is a option to select starting and closing date. Items, emission average, location, range of co2 emitted etc.
5. It would be better a visualization which shows their previous and future emimssion depending upon the current ongoing trend using ML/AI.
6. Enable responsive and adaptation for different screen size.

## Measurement Page

1. Implement pagination to prevent overwhelming large amount of information on a single page.
2. Enable sorting, filtering on table using different metrics such as datetime, items or quantity. One example is the [Data Table](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/#data-table) from MaterialUI.
3. For more readability, add a slightly different background for alternate rows on the table.
4. Enable responsive and adaptation for different screen size.
